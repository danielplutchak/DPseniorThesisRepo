## Week 1 Summary (09/27/2025)

### This week I worked on:

* Researching how a light meter works
* Creating my initial specification

### This week I learned:

* What LUX value is
* How a light meter translates LUX value to exposure settings
* ISO stand for International Organization for Standardaztion

### My successes this week were:

* Creating a solid initial spec that outlines the main features I want in my app
* Learning how light meters work

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* Figuring out how I will get access to a MAC to use Apple's IDE

## Week 2 Summary (10/05/2025)
### This week I worked on:

* Looking into options for getting my hands on a Mac or find a workaround
* Researching how double exposures work on light meters

### This week I learned:

* Using Xcode on a virtual machine does not work well for developing IOS apps according to multiple accounts online
* Purchasing a used Mac Mini is fairly inexpensive and would work for this project
* When using a normal light meter for multiple exposures, the final result usually comes out thin
* Swift is the programming language used for IOS app development 

### My successes this week were:

* Finding a feasible way to get my hands on a Mac
* Getting a better understanding with how light meters work for double exposures

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* Trying to understand how Swift works

---

## Week 3 Summary (10/12/2025)
### This week I worked on:

* Starting to understand Swift

### This week I learned:

* C++ and Swift do have a good amount of similarities (e.g. structs and functionality with C libraries)
* I will need to do some work in a test environment since I learn much better with hands-on work

### My successes this week were:

* Finding good resources to learn Swift

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* Understanding syntax in Swift

---

## Week 4 Summary (10/19/2025)
### This week I worked on:

* Learning Swift

### This week I learned:

* The differences between classes and structs and the difference between their C++ counterparts
* Swift's "Numerics" library

### My successes this week were:

* Starting to plan how I can implement the light meter calculations in swift
* Planning how the structure of my code will look like

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* Memorizing the syntax in Swift, I defintely need to spend more time with the language before I feel comfortable

---

## Week 5 Summary (10/26/2025)
### This week I worked on:

* Looking into options for a Mac if I cannot get one through Carthage
* Planning for how the backend for the light meter can be implemented

### This week I learned:

* The LUX value cannot be put directly into the formula to calculate EV, it needs to be converted into luminance
  * The LUX value is a measure of illuminance, which is how much light is falling on a surface, while luminance is the light that is reflected off of a surface

### My successes this week were:

* Researching how to convert a LUX value to EV

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* Getting my hands on a Mac
* Understanding the formulas to calculate EV

---

## Week 6 Summary (11/02/2025)
### This week I worked on:

* Learning Swift and XCode hands-on with a Mac

### This week I learned:

* How to display images, text, and built-in assets

### My successes this week were:

* Learning SwiftUI and thinking about how I could implement the built-in assets into my app

### The challenges I faced this week were:

* Trying to implement the built-in wheel selector, like there is in the timer app
